# JDLV-Raphael-TD5
Conway's Game of Life with customizable parameters (multiple populations, sizes, etc.)

## Features:
Multiple populations can be created for the same Game of Life, competing for their territory!

Customizable parameters such as board size, number and size of populations, etc.

## Setup/Troubleshoot
Simply clone this GitHub repository and run JDLV.py! To run it, open the file in VS Code or execute it from the terminal with:
`python3 {path_to_file}\JDLV.py`

If it doesn't work, make sure you have the `numpy` library installed or install it with `pip install numpy`

## Possible Additions and Improvements
- Add a visual interface, such as a GUI
- Improve the presentation by displaying an ASCII title and formatting questions
- Clear the console at each generation for better 'animation'
- Add colors for different populations
- Introduce new features!
